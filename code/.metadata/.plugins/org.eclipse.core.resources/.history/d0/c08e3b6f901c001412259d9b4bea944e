/**

 * @author Sebastian
 * 
 *         You end a command by sending a <CR> or <LF> or some combination of
 *         the two. This is how all commands must be terminated to be considered
 *         valid.
 * 
 *         The total number of bytes of each command, counting from the very
 *         first byte of the command name up to and including the <CR> at the
 *         end of the command must be 64 bytes or less. If it is longer than 64
 *         bytes, the command will be ignored, and other bad things may or may
 *         not happen.
 * 
 *         You can string together as many commands as you want into one string,
 *         and then send that string all at once to the UBW32. As long as each
 *         individual command is not more than 64 bytes, this will work well. By
 *         putting many commands together (each with their own terminating <CR>)
 *         and sending it all to the UBW32 at once, you make the most efficient
 *         use of the USB bandwidth.
 * 
 *         After successful reception of a command, the UBW32 will always send
 *         back an OK packet, which will consist of "OK<CR><LF>". For just
 *         testing things out with a terminal emulator, this is very useful
 *         because it tells you that the UBW32 understood your command. However,
 *         it does add extra communications overhead that may not be appreciated
 *         in a higher speed application. You can use the CU command to turn off
 *         the sending of "OK" packets. Errors will still be sent, but not any
 *         "OK" packets.
 * 
 *         All command names ("C", "BC", etc.) are case sensitive. In other
 *         words, "BC" is a different command from "bc".
 * 
 *         All port names ("A", "B", "C") are case insensitive. You can use "B"
 *         or "b" for port names.
